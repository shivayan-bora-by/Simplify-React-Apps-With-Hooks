# react-github-profile

An app to follow the tutorial from Kent C Dodds on [Simplifying React Apps with React Hooks](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-introduction-to-refactoring-a-react-application-to-react-hooks). Here we will convert an existing App using older class components and standards into new functional components using hooks and suspense.
